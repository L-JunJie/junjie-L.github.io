Hey, if you open this page by an accident, that means you have touched the most vulnerable part of my heart. I'm really sorry (scratching my head with a wry smile). 
I've had a lot of tears behind it, but I haven't say to too many peoples. All of those failure made me very pain. However, they made my heart stronger like a tin man. <br>
<br>
嘿，如果你在机缘巧合之下打开这个页面，那意味着你已经触碰到我心中最脆弱的部分。这可真不好意思啊（挠头苦笑）。这背后有不少我的泪水，我并没有对太多人倾诉。所有的失败都令我非常痛苦，但他们也让我的心脏
更加强大，如铁人一般。<br>
<br>
This funny GIF just be used to lighten the serious mood, cheers for all failures.
